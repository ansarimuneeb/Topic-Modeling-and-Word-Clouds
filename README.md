The project focused on analyzing reviews on dog treat products on the Amazon Website.

The following were the main findings of the project:

1- Focusing on the frequency of words occuring, most reviews revolved around teeth, breath, price and love for the product. Creation of topic model indicated certain words had a high probability of occuring together like "love", "price", "box", "size" and "teeth", "love", "breath", "day". With enough business context, we can say for certain that customer like the price of the box and the size of the dog treats as well as using the treat as a method of oral hygiene.

2- Sentiment Analysis revealed the most dominant emotions were "positive", "joy", "trust". There were also a considerable amount of "negative" emotions. However looking deeper into word counts for "negative" emotions revealed that the word "pet" was considered as negative. However given the business context, the occurance of the word "pet" does not indicate negative emotions and hence the strenght of "negative" sentiment is overstated.

3- Ignoring the negative sentiment of the word "pet", other words occuring more commonly with negative sentiment include "smell", "wait" and "choke". "Smell" could have either neutral or negative sentiment given the business context depending on whether customers think the treat smells bad or it makes the dog's breath smell good. "Wait" and "choke" indicate towards possibly problems where either customers had to wait a long time to get their delivery or they found the treat to be a choking hazard for the pet.
